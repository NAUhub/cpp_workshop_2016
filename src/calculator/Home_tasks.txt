Task 1. Numbers notation
Write a program that for given decimal number will shows its binary representation.
Number should be readed from standard input, and binary representation shoud be written to standard output.

Example:
> Enter an number (decimal): 12 <Enter>
> Binary representation of 12 is: 0b1010

Tips: use a std::string to hold binary representation of the number;
      use "divide by two" method to find binary representation of the number.


Task 2. Fibonacci numbers
Write a program that computes n-th element of Fibonacci series.
Read 'n' from a standard input, and write a result for standard output.

Example:
> Enter position in Fibonacci series: 5 <Enter>
> 5-th element of the series is: 5

Tips: you can use either recursion or loop to find answer.
